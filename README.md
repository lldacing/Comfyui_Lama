原项目很久没更新了，修复出现的一些问题


# Comfyui-Lama

a costumer node is realized to remove anything/inpainting anything from a picture by mask inpainting. Many thanks to brilliant work 🔥🔥🔥 of project [lama](https://github.com/advimman/lama) and [inpatinting anything](https://github.com/geekyutao/Inpaint-Anything)!

# Nodes
- LamaaModelLoad
- LamaApply
- YamlConfigLoader:  Because lama load models with yaml config file. So I add a extra node which could transfer yaml file to object which can easily handle in following process.
   
# Models requirement
- [big-lama](https://huggingface.co/hhhzzz/big-lama/resolve/main/big-lama.ckpt) (put into models folder of customer node)

# To-do list
